The accounting standard sets the bar high for revenue recognition, ergo the rules that explicit rights exist.  The existence of implicit rights demonstrated by historical practice, verbal representations, and other informal understandings are not sufficient bases upon which to assert that explicit rights exist  (approved 10/26/09)."
